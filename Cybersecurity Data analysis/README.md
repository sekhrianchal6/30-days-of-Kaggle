#### The goal of this project is to leverage this dataset to enhance threat detection techniques in cloud environments. Potential uses include anomaly detection, classification models to differentiate between normal and suspicious traffic, and conducting security analyses to understand attack tactics and techniques.

#### To achieve this objective, the project utilizes various methodologies:

#### 1) Data Preprocessing: The first step involves preprocessing the data, which includes handling missing values and cleaning the data to ensure its quality and reliability. This step is crucial for ensuring that the subsequent analysis is based on accurate and complete data.

#### 2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Techniques: The core of the project involves employing EDA techniques to explore and analyze the data. These techniques include:
